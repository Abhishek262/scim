# Go SCIM 2
The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identities in 
cloud-based applications and services easier. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing 
schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying 
existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user 
management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide 
patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. ([more...](http://www.simplecloud.info/))
